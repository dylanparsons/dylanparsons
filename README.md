**Hey, I’m Dylan.**  
I build high-performance tools for real-time systems, automation, and computer vision.

My focus is on practical solutions—speeding up workflows, solving system bottlenecks, and creating developer tools that save time. I like working where performance and usability intersect.

**Tech I use:**  
C#/.NET, C++, Python, SQL, and whatever else gets the job done.

**Areas of interest:**  
- Performance optimization  
- Machine vision and diagnostics  
- Developer tooling  
- Real-time data systems

**Current side projects:**  
- Plug-and-play automation tools  
- Faster, smarter CI/CD setups  
- Applying computer vision outside of manufacturing

If you're into any of that, feel free to check out my repos or sponsor my work. Let’s build something useful.
