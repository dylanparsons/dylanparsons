I’m Dylan, and I build fast, practical tools for real-time systems, automation, and computer vision.

I like software that disappears into your workflow—tools that make things faster, cleaner, or just less annoying.

Most of my work is in .NET, C++, and Python. I’ve built everything from production-line defect detectors to custom CI pipelines, and I’m always chasing ways to make systems more responsive and maintainable.

Sponsorship helps me explore side projects, open source contributions, and occasionally buy a weird new sensor or some dog treats for my shop assistant.
