# Hey, I'm Dylan 👋

I'm a software engineer who loves building high-performance tools for real-time systems, automation, and computer vision.

Whether it's speeding up complex workflows, solving tricky system bottlenecks, or building dev tools to save people time — I like working where performance and practicality meet.

### 🛠️ I work with:
C#/.NET, C++, Python, SQL, and whatever else gets the job done. I'm into:
- ⚡ Performance optimization
- 🔍 Machine vision & diagnostics
- 🧠 Smarter developer tooling
- 🧰 Real-time data systems

### 🧪 Currently experimenting with:
- Building plug-and-play automation tools
- Making my CI/CD setups faster and smarter
- Exploring computer vision outside of manufacturing

If you’re into performance, tooling, or just solving hard problems — check out my repos or [sponsor my work](https://github.com/sponsors/dylanparsons). Let’s build cool things.
